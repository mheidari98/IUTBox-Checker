The next package is webdriver_manager, Let install it first,
```
pip install webdriver_manager
```
1.3 Web Drivers
Selenium requires a web driver to interface with the chosen browser. Web drivers is a package to interact with a web browser. It interacts with the web browser or a remote web server through a wire protocol which is common to all. You can check out and install the web drivers of your browser choice.
